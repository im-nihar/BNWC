              We would like to inform the public that we have noticed that some
              groups are sending emails and text messages to individuals seeking
              employment. These parties are falsely claiming to represent BNWC
              and are requesting job seekers to attend interviews for job
              openings with BNWC and to deposit certain amounts in various
              designated bank accounts. It is important to note that BNWC does
              not require or accept any payment or security deposit from job
              applicants during the selection process or when inviting
              candidates for interviews. For further information, please visit
